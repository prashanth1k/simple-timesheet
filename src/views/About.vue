        This is a simple timesheet application built using Vue, Vuetify and some
        coffee. With this app you can -
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Record your time on a daily basis</li>
        <li>Record time in a week</li>
        <li>Export your data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any and all data you entered will stay on your computer - we don't see
        them. You can use this application for free, and not without a care for
        the world.
